                <h1 class="card-title">Biography</h1>
                <p class="card-text">The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active 
                    between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. 
                    They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically
                    for the American television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. 
                    The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, 
                    and Peter Tork; and the English actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's
                    music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting 
                    duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. <br><br>The four actor-musicians were initially 
                    allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first
                    few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees". This was due in part to the 
                    amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose 
                    and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed
                    limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. All four contributed lead 
                    vocals to various tracks. They eventually fought for the right to collectively 
                    supervise all musical output under the band's name, acting as musicians,
                    singers, songwriters and producers. The television show was canceled in 1968 but 
                    the band continued to record music through 1971.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band The Monkees. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone showed him a copy of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane
                            boys" so he applied for the job. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blasé when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider
                            remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Stephen Stills had auditioned for the new television series about four pop-rock musicians but was turned down because the show's producers felt his hair and teeth would not photograph well on camera.[10] They asked Stills if he knew of someone
                            with a similar "open, Nordic look," and Stills suggested Tork audition for the part. Tork got the job and became one of the four members of the Monkees, a fictitious pop band in the mid-1960s, created for a television sitcom written about
                            the fictitious band. Tork was the oldest member of the group.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was
                            taught how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself. He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making his right
                            leg weak.</p>

                            and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".</p>
